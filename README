	FONT FILES NOT INCLUDED
 	
 	Font files for the title image in the header are not included in the repo/theme, because they are restricted and licensed. 
 	
 	If you are licensed to use the fonts, and have a copy of them, simply insert them into the font 
 	directory, and make sure they match the file names referenced in font/create-header.php 
 	
 	Eventually, the title image will be generated using a centrally supported service, to remove the burden of site owners needing to purchase
 	a copy of the font files.
 	
 	If you do not have the font files, simply change the <img src=...> tag in page.tpl.php to the location of your own title image file.
